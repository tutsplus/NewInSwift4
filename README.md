# Envato Tuts+ Tutorial: [What's New in Swift 4][published url]
## Instructor: [Patrick Balestra][instructor url]


Swift 4 has been in the works for the last few months. If you're like me, you might follow Swift Evolution to stay up-to-date with all the proposals and changes. Even if you do, now is a good time to review all the additions and changes to the language in this new iteration.

A snapshot of Swift 4 was already available a few weeks before Xcode 9 was announced at WWDC 2017. In this post you'll learn all about the new features introduced in Swift 4â€”from brand new APIs to improvements to the language syntax.
